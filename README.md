# MTGAConstructedInfo
## App Info
Very basic implementation to parse the output_log.txt file generated by the MTG Arena application to get constructed ranked info and drop it into a file. The intended use is for twitch streamers to be able to. Updates immediately when ran and then once every 35 seconds.
## Build Info
How to generate executable: go to project directory in command line or use VS package manager console & run `dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained`
