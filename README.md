# MTGAConstructedInfo
## App Info
Very basic implementation to parse the output_log.txt file generated by the MTG Arena application to get constructed ranked info and drop it into a file. The intended use is for twitch streamers to be able to.
This will continue to work as long as the file at "<your windows user path>/AppData/LocalLow/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/output_log.txt stays the same.  If wizards decides to change they way they report the rank info, this program will break, so keep an eye on that! Updates immediately when ran and then once every 35 seconds. 

After running the program, the file can be linked with a text reader on OBS and is located at <your windows user path>/AppData/LocalLow/MTGARankInfo/MTGAContructedInfo\MTGAConstructedRankInfo.txt
