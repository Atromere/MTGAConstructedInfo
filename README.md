# MTGAConstructedInfo
Very basic implementation to parse the output_log.txt file generated by the MTG Arena application to get constructed ranked info and drop it into a file.
The intended use is for twitch streamers to be able to.

How to generate executable: go to project directory in command line or use VS package manager console & run "dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64 --self-contained"
